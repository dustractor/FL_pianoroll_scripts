# Select Every Nth

Like the built in function select odd but that one only cares about the grid and this one works no matter how the notes are spaced.  Will eventually add a fuzz factor so it ignores strum and flam notes within a certain range.

# Shave Selected

Shaves both ends of selected notes by a small amount. I use a certain midi plugin that doesn't re-trigger notes if they are legato. It also behaves better if the notes are slightly behind the beat. This script shortens the notes by a few pulses and shifts them forward. When the notes come out the other end of the midi plugin I can always just quantize them back.
