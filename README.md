# Select Every Nth

Like the built in function select odd but that one only cares about the grid and this one works no matter how the notes are spaced.  Can stack three values for n.  Can choose to restrict only to one color.

# Shave

Shaves both ends of notes by a small amount. I use a certain midi plugin that doesn't re-trigger notes if they are legato. It also behaves better if the notes are slightly behind the beat. This script shortens the notes by a few pulses and shifts them forward. When the notes come out the other end of the midi plugin I can always just quantize them back.

# Select Chords

Select chords.  Optionally, select only chords of a given color.

# Select lowest note of chords

Select only the bottom note of each chord with optional color filter.

# Select highest note of chords

Select only the top note of each chord with optional color filter.
